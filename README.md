# Analyzing-1881-UK-Census-Data-for-Development-Recommendations

This project analyzes a simulated 1881 UK census dataset for a small town situated between two major cities, aiming to identify investment opportunities and make development recommendations for an unused plot of land. The dataset, which contains 11 attributes and 8577 entries, was cleaned to address missing entries and incorrect data types using Python in a Jupyter notebook. Key analyses included assessing religion, age, and marital status distributions. For instance, missing religious affiliations for minors were handled by imputing values based on family surname, and ages were converted to integers and grouped for demographic analysis. The findings suggested minimal need for additional religious facilities due to a high number of non-religious individuals, a significant portion of the population in the 30-49 age group, and an anticipated rise in retired individuals. These insights led to recommendations for investment in end-of-life care, family housing, and educational facilities, supporting informed decision-making for local government planning and resource allocation.
